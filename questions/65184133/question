Dude :/

why did you flag my post as duplicate. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65184133/qt-include-python-h-into-c-full-guide-qt-5-15-python-3-9-windows

both of your other questions were not giving the full context. 
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44125902/how-can-i-include-python-h-in-qmake)
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27045323/embedding-python-3-4-into-c-qt-application)

That is the reason why I sit down for an hour and tried to give something back. Maybe even for myself when i later might need it. 
And now i am sad and a little bit angry, that all this work is for nothing. and the next guy having the same problem as myself, will also struggle, becouse there is no one single full solution.
For example in both of these questions, ther was zero mention, that the dll. need to be placed in side the folders... Also the information of how to link on windows was different...
Men 
i am really sad ._. 
i just wanted to give something back....
